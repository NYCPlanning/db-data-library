      ### ESRI Shapefile
      The Census Blocks for the 2010 US Census clipped to shoreline. These boundary files are derived
      from the US Census Bureau's TIGER project and have been geographically modified to fit the
      New York City base map. Because some census blocks are under water not all census blocks
      are contained in this file, only census blocks that are partially or totally located on land have
      been mapped in this file.
