      # Known Project Database
      The Known Projects DB contains information on future housing starts.
      It gathers data from 9-11 data sources (depending on use case, see below), compares the information in each data source to ensure that units existing 
      in multiple sources are not counted more than once, and then aggregates these sources. It incorporates granular information at the project-level,
      including project statuses, estimated project phasing, and borough planner input on projects where available.
